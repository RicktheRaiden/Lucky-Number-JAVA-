Lucky numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that remain after removing second, third, fourth, fifth and so on numbers respectively from a sequence of consecutive natural numbers. Deletion of every sixth number is not possible and the five numbers that are lucky to escape deletion remain indefinitely. This code is particularly written in java where it asks the user to enter any positive natural number 'N' where (1<=N<=50) and generate lucky numbers less than the given natural number.
